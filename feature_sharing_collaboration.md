# Feature: Quiz Sharing and Collaboration

This document details the "Quiz Sharing and Collaboration" feature set for QuizGPT. These capabilities aim to transform QuizGPT into an interactive platform for users to distribute their quizzes and work together on creating high-quality educational content.

## 1. Quiz Sharing

This component focuses on providing users with flexible ways to share the quizzes they have created or finalized.

### Sharing Mechanisms:

*   **Unique Link Generation:**
    *   **Functionality:** For any quiz, a user can generate a unique, persistent URL.
    *   **Usage:** This link can be easily copied and distributed via email, messaging applications, social media platforms, or embedded within Learning Management Systems (LMS).
*   **Direct Email Invitations:**
    *   **Functionality:** The QuizGPT interface will allow users to send email invitations directly to specific individuals.
    *   **Usage:** Users can input one or more email addresses, and the system will dispatch an email containing a link to the quiz and an optional custom message from the sender.
*   **Embeddable Quizzes (Future Enhancement):**
    *   **Functionality:** The system could generate a snippet of HTML code (e.g., an `<iframe>`) that allows the quiz to be embedded directly into external websites, blogs, or educational portals.

### Access Control Options:

Users will have granular control over who can access their shared quizzes:

*   **Public:**
    *   **Accessibility:** The quiz is accessible to anyone who has the link.
    *   **Discoverability (Optional):** Public quizzes might be listed in a publicly searchable repository or gallery within the QuizGPT platform, allowing for broader discovery.
*   **Unlisted (Anyone with the Link):**
    *   **Accessibility:** The quiz can be accessed by anyone who possesses the unique URL.
    *   **Discoverability:** It will not be publicly listed or searchable within QuizGPT, ensuring a degree of privacy while still allowing broad sharing if the link is distributed.
*   **Specific Users / Registered Users Only:**
    *   **Accessibility:** Only users explicitly invited by the owner or those who are registered QuizGPT users (and potentially part of a specific group if group functionality exists) can access the quiz.
    *   **Verification:** This typically requires users to be logged into their QuizGPT account to verify their identity and permissions.
*   **Password Protected:**
    *   **Accessibility:** Users can set a password for their quiz. Anyone who receives the link will need to enter the correct password to view or attempt the quiz.

## 2. Collaborative Quiz Creation

This component enables multiple users to jointly create, edit, and refine a single quiz.

### How Collaboration Works:

*   The primary author or "owner" of a quiz can invite other registered QuizGPT users to become collaborators.
*   Invitations can be sent via email or by searching for users within the QuizGPT system.
*   Once an invitation is accepted, collaborators can access the quiz's editing interface according to the permissions assigned to them.

### Key Collaboration Features:

*   **Role-Based Access Control (Permissions):**
    *   **Owner:** Has complete control over the quiz. This includes editing all aspects, managing collaborators (inviting, changing roles, revoking access), setting sharing permissions, and deleting the quiz. Typically, a quiz has one owner.
    *   **Editor:** Can add, delete, and modify questions; change quiz settings (e.g., title, description, difficulty parameters); and view version history. Cannot delete the quiz or manage other collaborators' access unless explicitly granted extended permissions.
    *   **Viewer (or Commenter):** Can view the quiz content and its structure in the editor but cannot make direct changes. A "Commenter" role might additionally allow leaving comments or suggestions on specific questions or the quiz as a whole.
*   **Version History:**
    *   **Functionality:** The system will automatically save snapshots or versions of the quiz at various points (e.g., after each significant editing session or on manual save).
    *   **Benefits:** Allows collaborators to track changes over time, see who made specific edits (if attribution is included), and revert the quiz to a previous state if necessary (e.g., to recover from accidental deletions or major unwanted changes).
*   **Collaboration Model:**
    *   **Asynchronous Collaboration (Core):** Users can work on the quiz at different times. Changes made by one collaborator are saved and become visible to others when they next open the quiz. This is the fundamental mode of collaboration.
    *   **Real-time Collaboration (Advanced Feature):** For a more dynamic experience, QuizGPT could support simultaneous editing. Changes made by one user would appear instantly on the screens of other active collaborators. This might include features like visible cursors of other users and live updates to text and settings.
*   **Change Tracking and Attribution (Desirable):**
    *   Visually highlighting changes made by different users or indicating who last modified a question can enhance transparency and accountability within the collaborative process.
*   **Commenting and Discussion Threads (Desirable):**
    *   An integrated commenting system would allow collaborators to leave notes, ask questions, or discuss specific aspects of the quiz (e.g., the wording of a question, the choice of distractors) directly within the editing interface.

## 3. Benefits of Sharing and Collaboration

These features are expected to provide substantial value:

*   **Fosters a Learning Community:** Sharing quizzes allows users to contribute to and benefit from a wider pool of educational resources, encouraging knowledge exchange.
*   **Enables Teamwork for Educators:** Teachers and instructional designers can collaborate on creating standardized assessments, departmental exams, or comprehensive question banks, saving time, distributing workload, and improving the overall quality and consistency of educational materials.
*   **Supports Student Study Groups:** Students can work together to create practice quizzes, helping them to actively engage with course material, test their collective understanding, and prepare more effectively for exams.
*   **Wider Distribution and Increased Impact:** Well-crafted quizzes, when shared, can reach a larger audience, thereby amplifying the educational impact of the QuizGPT platform.
*   **Peer Review and Quality Enhancement:** Collaboration facilitates peer review of quiz content. Multiple perspectives can help identify errors, improve question clarity, refine distractors, and ensure the overall pedagogical soundness of quizzes.
*   **Diverse Perspectives in Quiz Design:** Bringing together collaborators with different backgrounds and expertise can lead to more comprehensive, creative, and well-rounded quizzes that cater to a broader range of learners.

## 4. Technical Considerations

Implementing robust sharing and collaboration requires careful architectural planning:

*   **Shared Quiz Data Management:**
    *   **Database Schema:** The database design must support shared ownership and permissions. This likely involves linking tables for quizzes, users, and their respective roles/permissions for each quiz (e.g., a `quiz_collaborators` table with `quiz_id`, `user_id`, `role_id`).
    *   **Access Control Logic:** Backend logic must rigorously enforce the defined access levels (public, unlisted, specific users, password-protected) at both the API and application layers to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.
*   **Handling Concurrent Edits (especially for Real-time Collaboration):**
    *   **Conflict Resolution Strategies:** Mechanisms are needed to manage situations where multiple users attempt to modify the same data simultaneously. Common approaches include:
        *   **Last Write Wins (LWW):** Simplest to implement, but can lead to unintentional data loss.
        *   **Operational Transformation (OT):** More complex, algorithmically transforms operations to ensure consistency despite concurrency. Used by systems like Google Docs.
        *   **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs):** Data structures designed for decentralized environments that can merge concurrent updates predictably.
        *   **Locking (Pessimistic or Optimistic):** Temporarily restricting editing of a specific element (e.g., a single question) to one user at a time.
    *   **Communication Protocol:** For real-time updates, technologies like WebSockets will be essential for low-latency, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
*   **Versioning System:**
    *   A robust system for storing and retrieving historical versions of quizzes. This might involve storing full snapshots of quiz data (e.g., as JSON objects) or, for efficiency, storing deltas (the differences between versions).
*   **Notification System:**
    *   To alert users to relevant events, such as new invitations to collaborate, significant changes made to a shared quiz by other users, or new comments/discussions requiring their attention.
*   **Scalability and Performance:** The infrastructure must be designed to scale efficiently as the number of users, shared quizzes, and concurrent collaborative sessions grows, ensuring responsive performance.

By addressing these aspects, the "Quiz Sharing and Collaboration" feature will significantly enhance QuizGPT's value proposition, making it a more versatile, interactive, and community-oriented platform for education and learning.
