# Feature: Differentiation of Questions by Difficulty Level

This document outlines the "Differentiation of Questions by Difficulty Level" feature for QuizGPT.

## 1. User Specification of Difficulty Level

Users will be able to specify their desired difficulty level for the quiz questions during the quiz generation process. This can be implemented through a user-friendly interface element, such as:

*   **Dropdown Menu:** A simple dropdown list offering predefined options like "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard." This is a straightforward and common approach.
*   **Radio Buttons:** Clear and distinct radio button options for each difficulty level (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard). This provides good visibility of all options simultaneously.
*   **Slider (Optional/Advanced):** A slider control could allow for a more granular selection of difficulty, potentially on a numerical scale (e.g., 1-5). This might be considered for future enhancements if more fine-grained control is desired.

The selected difficulty level will be a key input parameter for the quiz generation engine. For the initial implementation, a dropdown menu or radio buttons are recommended for simplicity and clarity.

## 2. Benefits of the Feature

Introducing difficulty levels offers several significant advantages:

*   **Caters to Diverse Learning Needs:** Users, whether students or self-learners, possess varying levels of understanding and prior knowledge. Difficulty levels allow educators and learners to tailor quizzes to specific learning stages. Beginners can start with "Easy" questions to build foundational knowledge and confidence, while advanced learners can challenge themselves with "Hard" questions to deepen their understanding.
*   **More Targeted Assessments:** Educators can create quizzes that accurately assess understanding at specific cognitive levels. For instance:
    *   **Easy questions** might test recall of facts, basic definitions, and straightforward comprehension.
    *   **Medium questions** could focus on the application of concepts, interpretation of information, and solving typical problems.
    *   **Hard questions** could evaluate critical thinking, analysis of complex scenarios, synthesis of information from multiple sources, or evaluation of arguments.
*   **Supports Progressive Learning:** Users can systematically increase the difficulty of quizzes as their mastery of the subject matter improves. This provides a structured and motivating learning path.
*   **Increased User Engagement:** When quiz questions are appropriately challenging (i.e., not too easy to be boring, and not too difficult to be discouraging), user engagement, motivation, and persistence are likely to increase.
*   **Better Diagnostic Insights:** Analyzing user performance across different difficulty levels can provide educators and learners with more nuanced insights into areas of strength and areas where further study or different instructional approaches might be needed.
*   **Flexibility for Various Use Cases:** This feature allows QuizGPT to be used more effectively for a wider range of purposes, from quick knowledge checks to in-depth topic reviews or exam preparation.

## 3. Integration into the Existing System (GPT-based Question Generation)

Given that QuizGPT currently utilizes a GPT model for generating questions, integrating selectable difficulty levels can be primarily achieved by refining the prompts sent to the GPT API.

*   **Prompt Engineering is Key:** The core of the integration lies in "prompt engineering." The prompt that instructs the GPT model to generate questions will be augmented to explicitly include the desired difficulty level.
    *   Example for an "Easy" quiz on "Photosynthesis": `"Generate 5 easy multiple-choice questions suitable for a beginner, covering the basic concepts of Photosynthesis. Ensure the questions focus on recall and simple understanding."`
    *   Example for a "Hard" quiz on "Photosynthesis": `"Generate 5 hard multiple-choice questions on Photosynthesis that require critical thinking, application of knowledge, and perhaps analysis of hypothetical scenarios. Target these questions for advanced learners."`
*   **Using Difficulty Modifiers in Prompts:** Specific keywords, phrases, and instructional nuances will be incorporated into the prompts to guide the GPT model towards generating questions of the intended complexity. Examples of such modifiers include:
    *   **For Easy:** "basic recall," "define," "identify," "who/what/when/where," "simple comprehension," "straightforward."
    *   **For Medium:** "explain in your own words," "compare and contrast," "apply this concept to," "solve this typical problem," "give an example of."
    *   **For Hard:** "analyze critically," "evaluate the validity of," "synthesize information to solve," "what if," "design a solution for," "predict the outcome if."
*   **Iterative Refinement and Testing:** The effectiveness of these prompt modifications will require iterative testing and refinement. It will be important to generate sample quizzes at each difficulty level and have them reviewed by subject matter experts or target users to ensure the perceived difficulty aligns with the intended level. Based on feedback, the prompt strategies can be adjusted.
*   **Maintaining Question Quality:** While aiming for specific difficulty levels, it's crucial to ensure that the prompts also continue to guide the GPT model to produce well-phrased, unambiguous questions with clear correct answers and plausible distractors (for multiple-choice questions).
*   **Potential for Future Fine-tuning (Advanced Scope):** Looking further ahead, if a substantial dataset of questions accurately tagged with difficulty levels could be curated, fine-tuning a dedicated GPT model specifically for QuizGPT could potentially yield even more consistent and reliable generation of difficulty-specific questions. However, sophisticated prompt engineering is the most immediate and practical approach for the current system.

By implementing this feature, QuizGPT will become a more adaptive and powerful tool, significantly enhancing its utility for both educators creating assessments and individuals pursuing personalized learning.
